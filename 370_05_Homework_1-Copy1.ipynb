    "Rhyhtmic Gymnastics is the sport with the lowest median athlete age. To get this, I grouped the dataset by sport, and then took the median, which gave me the median of all the numeric columns for each sport. Then I took the Age column and put it in ascending order, which put the smallest (or youngest) on top. I displayed the top 5 here to ensure that there were no ties for the youngest median athlete age."

Initially, I got these just by dropping the people without any medals, selecting all the males/females and grouping by sport and getting the counts for each sport. After seeign the results though, I realized that some teams were listed in several different portions, like China, China-1, and China-2. After looking at the Kaggle page and finding to reason for this, I decided to go back and clean up the team names, getting rid of any dashes and numbers and combining the results back down in to one country. This led me to the 9 countries listed above."
